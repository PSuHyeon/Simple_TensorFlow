Define-by-run

Forward and backward method

automation of backward method

Memory allocation method using weak referencing

Efficiency conservation using 1. enable_backprop, 2. create_graph

Operator overload for usability

Higher order differentiation by using grpah construction for backward method

Double propagation

numpy broadcast detection + application of sum_to and broadcast in backward propagation
